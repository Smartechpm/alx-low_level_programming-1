# 0x14-bit_manipulation

## 0-binary_to_uint.c
> A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
> - Prototype: ``` unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b); ```.
> - ``` b ``` is pointing to a string of ``` 0 ``` and ``` 1 ``` chars.
> - Returns the converted number or 0: 
> * if theres one or more chars in the string ``` b ``` that is not ``` 0 ``` or ``` 1 ```.
> * ``` b ``` is ``` NULL ```.

## 1-print_binary.c
> A function that prints the binary representation of a number.
> - Prototype: ``` void print_binary(unsigned long int n); ```.
> - Using Bitwise AND.

## holberton.h
> Header file contains all function prototypes of functions in this project.
